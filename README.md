# OpenglGameEngine
i'm solo game developer who's current trying to build his own game engine.
<p>the engine is still not complete.
what libraries i (will) use:
</p><p>
- openGL, glew, glfw(will add Vulkan support later)

</p><p>
- Bullet Physics
</p><p>
- OpenAL for soundengine
</p><p>
-IMGui for UI
</p>

<p> The Actors types are defined by inheritance and not components. this approach have been taken to gain the more performance out of the C++ Language. besides if we are are talking about testability and upgradability then components based types are better then following Inheritance approach</p>
